# C++ Build Process: Compiler vs. Linker (and CMake Commands)

Understanding the difference between compiling and linking is key to understanding how a C++ program goes from source code to a runnable application. It's a multi-stage process, unlike the typical Java workflow which often feels more integrated.

## The Two Main Stages: Compilation and Linking

Imagine building something complex, like a car. You don't build the whole thing at once. You build individual components (engine, doors, wheels) first, and then you assemble them together. C++ building is similar.

### 1. The Compiler

*   **Job:** Translates your human-readable C++ source code (`.cpp` files) into low-level machine code instructions (specific to your CPU architecture, like ARM64 or x86-64).
*   **Input:** One or more source files (`.cpp`, `.cxx`, etc.) and the header files (`.h`, `.hpp`) they `#include`.
*   **Output:** **Object Files (`.o`)**. Each `.cpp` file is typically compiled into a corresponding `.o` file (e.g., `main.cpp` -> `main.cpp.o`).
    *   An object file contains the machine code for the functions and variables defined *in its specific source file*.
    *   Crucially, if your code calls a function defined in *another* `.cpp` file or in an external library (like `readline`), the object file **doesn't contain** the code for that function. It just contains a **placeholder** or **symbol** saying "I need the code for function X here". It also lists the symbols (functions/variables) it *provides* to others.
*   **Checks:** The compiler performs syntax checking. If you have typos, incorrect C++ syntax, or type mismatches *within a single file*, the compiler will report errors.
*   **Java Analogy:** The C++ compiler is somewhat analogous to the Java compiler (`javac`). `javac` takes your `.java` files and translates them into Java bytecode (`.class` files). Bytecode is also an intermediate, machine-independent code. `javac` checks Java syntax and resolves types based on imports. Like C++ object files, `.class` files are usually incomplete on their own; they reference other classes.

### 2. The Linker

*   **Job:** Takes all the individual object files (`.o`) created by the compiler, along with any external libraries (like `readline`, which comes as a pre-compiled `.dylib` or `.a` file on macOS), and combines them into a single, complete, runnable program (an **executable file**).
*   **Input:** One or more object files (`.o`) and potentially library files (`.a`, `.so`, `.dylib`).
*   **Output:** A single executable file (e.g., `simple-db` on Linux/macOS, `simple-db.exe` on Windows).
*   **Action:** The linker's main task is **symbol resolution**. It looks at all the placeholders ("I need function X") in each object file and finds the object file or library that provides the actual code for function X. It then "links" the call site to the actual code. It also combines all the machine code into the final file in the correct structure for the operating system to load and run.
*   **Checks:** The linker checks if all necessary symbols (functions/variables) were found. If your code calls a function `do_something()` but no object file or library provides the implementation for `do_something()`, the linker will report an "undefined symbol" error. (This is like a `NoClassDefFoundError` or `NoSuchMethodError` in Java, but caught *before* running the program).
*   **Java Analogy:** There isn't a perfect single analogy in standard Java development. It's somewhat like a combination of:
    *   The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) **loading** different `.class` files at runtime and **linking** them together by resolving method calls between classes.
    *   Tools like `jar` packaging multiple `.class` files into a single runnable JAR archive (though `jar` doesn't usually resolve internal symbols in the same way a C++ linker does).
        The key idea is combining separate compiled units and resolving references between them.

## Digging into the CMake Commands used for building `simple-db`

**Command 1: `cmake . -B build` (Configuration)**

```shell
~/github-personal/simple-db main >2 > cmake . -B build
-- The C compiler identification is AppleClang 15.0.0.15000309 # CMake finds your C++ compiler
-- The CXX compiler identification is AppleClang 15.0.0.15000309 # (CXX means C++)
-- Detecting C compiler ABI info # Internal CMake checks
-- Detecting C compiler ABI info - done
-- Check for working C compiler: ... - skipped # Checks if compiler works (skips if already done)
-- Detecting C compile features
-- Detecting C compile features - done
-- Detecting CXX compiler ABI info
-- Detecting CXX compiler ABI info - done
-- Check for working CXX compiler: ... - skipped
-- Detecting CXX compile features
-- Detecting CXX compile features - done
-- Found PkgConfig: /opt/homebrew/bin/pkg-config (found version "2.4.3") # Finds the pkg-config tool
-- Checking for module 'readline' # Runs pkg-config to check for readline.pc
-- Found readline, version 8.2 # pkg-config succeeded!
-- Configuring done (0.7s)
-- Generating done (0.0s)
-- Build files have been written to: /Users/akjn/github-personal/simple-db/build # IMPORTANT!
```

*   **What this command does:** This command **does not compile or link anything**. It's the **configuration** step.
*   It reads your `CMakeLists.txt`.
*   It finds your compiler (`AppleClang`).
*   It finds helper tools (`pkg-config`).
*   It uses `pkg-config` to check *if* the `readline` library exists and *where* its headers and library files are (getting the compiler/linker flags needed later).
*   Its main **output** is the set of **build files** (e.g., Makefiles) inside the `build` directory. These files contain the *actual* commands that need to be run to compile and link your project, using the paths and flags CMake figured out. Think of it as CMake creating a detailed instruction manual for the build tool (`make` or `ninja`).

**Command 2: `cmake --build build` (Building)**

```shell
~/github-personal/simple-db main >2 > cmake --build build
[ 50%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/simple-db.dir/main.cpp.o # <-- COMPILER runs here
[100%] Linking CXX executable simple-db # <-- LINKER runs here
[100%] Built target simple-db
```

You can run it in verbose mode to see, for example, the `readline` library being linked:
```shell
~/github-personal/simple-db main >2 ?1 > cmake --build build -- VERBOSE=1
/opt/homebrew/bin/cmake -S/Users/akjn/github-personal/simple-db -B/Users/akjn/github-personal/simple-db/build --check-build-system CMakeFiles/Makefile.cmake 0

```

*   **What this command does:** This command tells CMake to execute the build process using the instructions it generated in the `build` directory during the configuration step. CMake usually invokes an underlying build tool like `make` or `ninja`.
*   **`[ 50%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/simple-db.dir/main.cpp.o`:** This is the **Compiler** in action! It's running `AppleClang` to translate `main.cpp` into the object file `main.cpp.o`. If you had more `.cpp` files, you'd see similar lines for them.
*   **`[100%] Linking CXX executable simple-db`:** This is the **Linker** in action! It's running the linker part of `AppleClang`. It takes the object file `main.cpp.o` and links it with the `readline` library (using the flags `-L... -lreadline` obtained via `pkg-config` during the configuration step) to produce the final executable file named `simple-db` inside the `build` directory.

## Summary Table

| Feature          | Compiler                                        | Linker                                                   |
|:-----------------|:------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Input**        | `.cpp` source files, `.h` headers               | `.o` object files, library files (`.a`, `.dylib`, `.so`) |
| **Output**       | `.o` object files (machine code)                | Executable file (or shared library)                      |
| **Main Job**     | Translate C++ to machine code                   | Combine object files/libraries, resolve symbols          |
| **Checks**       | Syntax errors, type errors (within file)        | Undefined symbols (missing functions/variables)          |
| **Java Analogy** | `javac` (produces `.class` files)               | JVM Class Loading/Linking, `jar` tool (approximate)      |
| **CMake Step**   | Part of `cmake --build build` (Building object) | Part of `cmake --build build` (Linking executable)       |

So, `cmake . -B build` prepares the instructions, and `cmake --build build` executes those instructions, first running the compiler for each source file and then running the linker to combine everything.
