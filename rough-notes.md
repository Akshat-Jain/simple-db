# Rough Notes

This is a dump of my thoughts when exploring different alternatives for xyz stuff.


Other handy things:
1. `files-to-prompt . | pbcopy`
2. Older chat: https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/17DRNPhY1QuXOOECcAXZGttiH5vi1Qd8g
3. Newer chat: https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/1olmlfe1X55D7MrO6T1V4RE8JPyqr4ggu


Todo:
1. Rename include guards from COMMAND_H to SIMPLEDB_COMMAND_H, to avoid conflicts with other libraries if they also have COMMAND_H.
2. Update application.log filepath to also use ENV_DATA_DIR.
